**IPL Data Analysis & Excel Dashboard**
This project presents an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and interactive Excel Dashboard based on Indian Premier League (IPL) match data.
It combines powerful insights using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) and Excel visualizations, making it ideal for data storytelling, analytics resumes, and placement projects.

**Project Objectives**

Perform structured EDA on IPL match and player data
Extract key performance metrics (team, toss, venue, batsmen)
Create interactive charts and summaries using Excel Dashboard
Enable stakeholders to explore match dynamics and trends

**Dataset**

Source: IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008–2025 datasets from Kaggle
Files: IPL.csv
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chaitu20/ipl-dataset2008-2025

**EDA Highlights (Python)**

Using Python (Jupyter Notebook or .py script), the following insights were extracted:

Team Performance Summary – wins, toss outcomes, match results
Toss Impact – win % when toss is won
Venue Analysis – most played & winning grounds
Top Batsmen – consistent high scorers
Run Momentum Graph – cumulative runs over overs per innings

**Excel Dashboard Features**

The final output is a professional dashboard built in Excel:
Section	Description
IPL Dashboard Header (merged & styled)
Team Performance Table
Toss Impact Bar Chart
Top Batsmen Summary Table
Venue-wise Win Distribution Pie Chart
Run Momentum Line Chart (Cumulative Runs vs Overs)

**Tools Used**

Python – pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
Excel – Charts (line, bar, pie), formatting
